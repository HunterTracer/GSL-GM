/*
 * Computes the cumulative distribution function for the Gaussian
 * distribution using a rational function approximation.  The
 * computation is for the standard Normal distribution, i.e., mean 0
 * and standard deviation 1. If you want to compute Pr(X < t) for a
 * Gaussian random variable X with non-zero mean m and standard
 * deviation sd not equal to 1, find gsl_cdf_ugaussian ((t-m)/sd).
 * This approximation is accurate to at least double precision. The
 * accuracy was verified with a pari-gp script.  The largest error
 * found was about 1.4E-20. The coefficients were derived by Cody.
